<h1>How Threonine Suppliers Like Promois International Support Swine Performance </h1><br>

High-quality Threonine suppliers are instrumental in helping swine farmers optimize their feed programs. Let’s explore some ways Promois International contributes to enhanced swine nutrition:

1. Ensuring Precise Amino Acid Balancing
Promois International offers feed-grade Threonine that allows swine farmers to fine-tune amino acid levels in animal feed. By supplementing diets with Threonine, producers can achieve an optimal balance of essential amino acids—especially Lysine and Methionine—leading to improved protein synthesis and growth.
2. Improving Feed Conversion Ratios (FCR)
Supplementing with Threonine helps pigs utilize feed more efficiently, meaning they convert more of their intake into body mass. This improved feed conversion ratio helps farmers reduce feed costs while maintaining productivity, a critical advantage in today’s competitive livestock industry.
3. Boosting Immune Function and Disease Resistance
Threonine supports mucin production in the intestines, promoting gut health and preventing infections. This is especially important for young pigs and weaning piglets, which are prone to digestive issues. By improving immune response, Threonine supplementation can reduce the incidence of diseases, minimizing the need for antibiotics.
4. Supporting Sustainable and Antibiotic-Free Farming
With the industry shifting towards antibiotic-free farming practices, Threonine is increasingly used to maintain animal health and performance naturally. Promois International's Threonine products align with this trend by helping producers maintain healthy growth rates without relying on antibiotics.
